Higher Order Component

The Component takes component as paramerter and return enhanced component of it

useCases:
If multiple components need of same functionality. we can create HOC and place common logic in HOC.
And pass that logic as prop to wrappedComponents under HOC

const hoc = (WrappedComponent) => {

    const NewComponent = () => {
    //common logic

    render() {
        return (
            <WrappedComponent logic={logic}/>
        )
    }
    }

    return NewComponent
}

const comp1 = () => {

    const {logic} = props

    render() {
        return (
            <div>{logic}</div>
        )
    }

}

export default hoc(comp1)
