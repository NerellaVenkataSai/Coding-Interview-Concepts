React's StrictMode is sort of a helper component that will help you write better react components, you can wrap a set of components with <StrictMode /> and it'll basically:

Verify that the components inside are following some of the recommended practices and warn you if not in the console.
Verify the deprecated methods are not being used, and if they're used strict mode will warn you in the console.
Help you prevent some side effects by identifying potential risks.


I've found it especially useful to implement strict mode .
when I'm working on new code bases and I want to see what kind of code/components I'm facing. 
Also if you're on bug hunting mode, sometimes it's a good idea to wrap with <StrictMode /> 
the components/blocks of code you think might be the source of the problem.
