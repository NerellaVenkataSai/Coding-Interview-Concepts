 Rich offline experiences, periodic background syncs, push notifications—functionality 
 that would normally require a native application—are coming to the web. 
 Service workers provide the technical foundation that all these features rely on.

A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Today, they already include features like push notifications and background sync. In the future, service workers might support other things like periodic sync or geofencing.

We can use service workers to intercept in network calls and managing cache of responses.

LifeCycle of service Worker refer image 1
1. Installing
  To install service worker to web page we need to register service worker. 
  Once you register service worker browser will install service worker in background.
  /**
    navigator.serviceWorker
        .register('/sw.js', {
          scope: '/',
        })
        .then((registration) => {
          APP.SW =
            registration.installing ||
            registration.waiting ||
            registration.active;
          console.log('service worker registered');
        });
  */

  ***Important Note***
  1.Regestration of service worker is done using navigator object in javascript(ref 2 link)
  2.In localhost it can be used using http but once app is deployed serviceWorker can only be used
  Using https

  3.Once service worker is registered it will registered based on domain. so same service worker will
  be used accross different tabs for web app. so we can comminicate between two tabs using service worker.

2. Activation
When installed, the activation step will follow and this is a great opportunity for handling any management of old caches.
 After installing service worker it will have all controll on all pages under its (scope). refer 2 link
