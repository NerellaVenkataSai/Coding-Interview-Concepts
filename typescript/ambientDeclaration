Ambient declarations are a way of telling the TypeScript compiler that the actual 
source code exists elsewhere. When you are consuming a bunch of third party js libraries 
like jquery/angularjs/nodejs you canâ€™t rewrite it in TypeScript. 
Ensuring typesafety and intellisense while using these libraries 
will be challenging for a TypeScript programmer. 
Ambient declarations help to seamlessly integrate other js libraries into TypeScript.
